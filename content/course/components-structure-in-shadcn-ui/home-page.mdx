### C: shadcn-ui/ui
#### L: Home Page

Shadcn-ui/ui provides beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

In this lesson, we are only focusing on the folder structure, file naming conventions and how the page is built.
To begin with, we picked https://ui.shadcn.com/, that is, the home page.

# Home Page

This home page source code is found at [app/(app)/page.tsx](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/(app)/page.tsx).

## Components imported

The following components are imported in the home page, found at [app/(app)/page.tsx](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/(app)/page.tsx)

```js
import { Announcement } from "@/components/announcement"
import { ExamplesNav } from "@/components/examples-nav"
import {
  PageActions,
  PageHeader,
  PageHeaderDescription,
  PageHeaderHeading,
} from "@/components/page-header"
import { Button } from "@/registry/new-york/ui/button"
import MailPage from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/page"
```

There are few observations that can be made here:

- Component name follows PascalCase naming convention.
Example: `Announcement`, `ExamplesNav`, `PageActions`, `PageHeader`, `PageHeaderDescription` etc.,

- Import alias used.
You will find the below code snippet in [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/tsconfig.json#L19C5-L20C22)

```json
"paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"],
}
```

"@/" is the default import alias in Next.js.

- File naming convention.
File names such as `examples-nav`, `page-header` seem to be following kebab-case convention.

- Folder structure
Components used in this home page are found to be imported from 

1. `components` folder

![Shadcn-ui/ui Components Structure](/components-structure/shadcn-components-folder.png)

Components folder does not have any nested folders. All the components that are used across the shadcn-ui/ui are located in this folder.

These components are different from what you see on https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components. 
Different how? https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components provides the components that can be copied and pasted and these reside in [`registry`](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/registry). 
However, `components` provides building blocks that are built using components from registry and are used in pages.


2. `registry/new-york/ui` folder

[registry/new-york/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/registry/new-york/ui) contains the components 
the components that you see at https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components.

This ui folder is what you get when you initialise shadcn-ui/ui via the CLI.
There's no need to create a folder named registry and put your ui components in there because shadcn-ui/ui already 
does this for you via the CLI.


3. `@/app/(app)/examples/mail` folder 

[@/app/(app)/examples/mail](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail) this is an interesting
use case because this imports the whole MailPage.

What does this tell us? it means, you can use a page as a component, 
that is MailPage in this case, by importing in another page. 

# Conclusion:

You will find this common pattern across the entire shadcn-ui/ui pages using the app router. Components used are either imported 
from components folder or imported registry/new-york/ui folder which is the exact folder that shadcn-ui/ui creates for you
in your project when you initialise it via CLI. There is one special use case where a MailPage is imported in Home Page
to show MailPage on the landing page.
