title: How the userId is added to the tRPC ctx in LobeChat source code?
toc: true
---

In this article, we analyse how the currently logged-in userId is added to the tRPC ctx by reviewing LobeChat source code. I recommend [reading this tRPC setup](https://trpc.io/docs/client/react/server-components) to relate to the concepts explained in this article.

But before that, I want to explain how I found this. I study LobeChat source code and was working on a project that involved tRPC + Supabase in a Next.js app router. I am following the similar codebase architecture to LobeChat’s.

LobeChat uses Clerk for Authentication, the feature I was working required auth wall before making a request to the backend. Since I am following the LobeChat codebase principles, I just had to figure out how LobeChat configured `authedProcedure`.

When reading open-source code, I always use documentation to set my direction, otherwise I would be lost as these projects massive. This way, at the step — [Create a tRPC router](https://trpc.io/docs/client/nextjs/setup#3-create-a-trpc-router), you will find this code below:

```js
import * as trpcNext from '@trpc/server/adapters/next';
import { appRouter } from '../../../server/routers/_app';
// export API handler
// @link https://trpc.io/docs/v11/server/adapters
export default trpcNext.createNextApiHandler({
 router: appRouter,
 createContext: () => ({}),
});
```

`createContext` in this documentation returns an object but that is not the case with LobeChat’s createContext. createContext is configured when you define your route, this means we should be looking at [trpc/lambda/\[trpc\]/route.ts](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/%28backend%29/trpc/lambda/%5Btrpc%5D/route.ts)

### createContext in LobeChat

You will find the createContext in [lambda/\[trpc\]/route.ts](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/%28backend%29/trpc/lambda/%5Btrpc%5D/route.ts)[.](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/%28backend%29/trpc/lambda/%5Btrpc%5D/route.ts%29.) This below code is from LobeChat:

```js
import { fetchRequestHandler } from '@trpc/server/adapters/fetch';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

import { pino } from '@/libs/logger';
import { createContext } from '@/server/context';
import { lambdaRouter } from '@/server/routers/lambda';

const handler = (req: NextRequest) =>
  fetchRequestHandler({
    /**
     * @link https://trpc.io/docs/v11/context
     */
    createContext: () => createContext(req),

    endpoint: '/trpc/lambda',

    onError: ({ error, path, type }) => {
      pino.info(`Error in tRPC handler (lambda) on path: ${path}, type: ${type}`);
      console.error(error);
    },

    req,
    router: lambdaRouter,
  });

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```

As you can see here, `createContext` is imported from `@/server/context`. Let’s now analyse `@/server/context` code. This below source code is picked from [@/server/context](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/server/context.ts#L19).

```js
/**
 * Creates context for an incoming request
 * @link https://trpc.io/docs/v11/context
 */
export const createContext = async (request: NextRequest): Promise<Context> => {
   // for API-response caching see https://trpc.io/docs/v11/caching
  const authorization = request.headers.get(LOBE_CHAT_AUTH_HEADER);
  let userId;
  let auth;
  if (enableClerk) {
    auth = getAuth(request);
    userId = auth.userId;
    return createContextInner({ authorizationHeader: authorization, clerkAuth: auth, userId });
   }
// …
```

In this code snippet, if `enableClerk` is true, `createContextInner` is called with `auth` in parameter object. This is it, this is how you set userId in createContext. `userId` is returned by `auth.userId`. `createContext`  
from the definition above only has to return object with the context set.

#### createContextInner function:

You will find this below code at [Line 19 in server/context.ts](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/server/context.ts#L19)

```js
/**
 * Inner function for `createContext` where we create the context.
 * This is useful for testing when we don't want to mock Next.js' request/response
 */
export const createContextInner = async (params?: {
 authorizationHeader?: string | null;
 clerkAuth?: ClerkAuth;
 nextAuth?: User;
 userId?: string | null;
}): Promise<AuthContext> => ({
 authorizationHeader: params?.authorizationHeader,
 clerkAuth: params?.clerkAuth,
 nextAuth: params?.nextAuth,
 userId: params?.userId,
});
```
