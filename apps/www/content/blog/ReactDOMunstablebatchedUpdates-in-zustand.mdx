In this article, we will look into the use of `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates` within a test case, specifically in Zustand, a popular state management library for React. We'll also break down the test and explain how batched updates enhance performance in React by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

# **Understanding the Test Case**

Here is the test case we’ll be examining:

This test case is written to verify that batched updates can be applied when using Zustand with React’s rendering system.

# **Breaking Down the Test Case**

**1\. Zustand Store Setup:** The first step involves creating a Zustand store using the `create` function:

```plaintext
const useBoundStore = create<CounterState>(
  (set) => ({   
  count: 0,   
  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })), }))
```

Here, the store maintains a simple state with a `count` property initialized to 0 and an `inc` function to increment the count. The `set` function is Zustand’s way of updating the state, similar to `setState` in React.

**2\. Counter Component:** The `Counter` component uses the `useBoundStore` to retrieve the current `count` and the `inc` function:

```plaintext
const { count, inc } = useBoundStore()
```

This component subscribes to the store’s state, and any changes to `count` will cause it to re-render with the new value.

**3\. Using** `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates` **for Performance:** Inside the `useEffect` hook, the `inc` function is called twice within a `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates` block:

```plaintext
useEffect(() => {   
  ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates(() => {     
    inc()     
    inc()   
  }) 
}, [inc])
```

This is where the magic happens. Normally, each call to `inc()` would trigger a separate update, causing two renders. However, by wrapping these calls in `unstable_batchedUpdates`, React is able to process them together in a single update, resulting in only one render. This optimizes performance by reducing the number of renders, which is especially useful in performance-critical applications.

**4\. Rendering the Component and Asserting the Result** Finally, the component is rendered, and the test waits for the `count` to reach 2:

```plaintext
const { findByText } = render(
  <>     
    <Counter />   
  </>, 
)  

await findByText('count: 2')
```

This assertion ensures that after two increments, the `count` is correctly updated and rendered as "count: 2".

# **What is** `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates`?

`ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates` is a method provided by React that allows multiple state updates to be processed in a single render cycle. By default, React batches updates triggered inside event handlers (for example, click event), meaning that if you update multiple states in response to a user interaction, React will render the component only once. However, outside of event handlers (like within `setTimeout` or `useEffect`), updates are not batched automatically.

But this has changed after React 18. Below are the screenshots picked from [react.dev](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide#automatic-batching)

Keep in mind, [documentation](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide#automatic-batching) suggests that updates inside of timeouts, promises, native event handlers or any other event will batch the same way as updates inside of React events. But in this [Zustand’s test case](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/v4.5.5/tests/basic.test.tsx#L166), batch updates are applied inside ``useEffect`.``This is where `unstable_batchedUpdates` becomes useful. It forces React to group multiple state updates into a single render, even outside of event-driven contexts, minimizing re-renders and improving performance.

**Example:**

Without `unstable_batchedUpdates`:

```plaintext
inc()  // triggers one render
inc()  // triggers another render
```

With `unstable_batchedUpdates`:

```plaintext
ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates(() => {
  inc()  // triggers only one render for both updates
  inc()
})
```

The method is labeled “unstable” because it’s not part of React’s official public API, but it is still widely used in the community for performance optimizations. It may become more stable or integrated as part of React’s new concurrent rendering capabilities in the future.

Fun fact: Zustand’s 4.5.5 release uses the version — 19.0.0-rc.0

# **Why Use** `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates` in Zustand?

Zustand is a lightweight state management library that works with React’s component lifecycle. Although Zustand efficiently handles state updates, React’s reactivity system will trigger renders every time the state changes. In scenarios where multiple state changes occur in a short period, using `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates` can prevent multiple re-renders and batch the updates, allowing for a smoother, more efficient user experience.

In the test case provided, calling `inc` twice within a batched update ensures that the `count` only updates once, making it more efficient compared to running each update individually.
