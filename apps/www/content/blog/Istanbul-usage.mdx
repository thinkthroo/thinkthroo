title: Istanbul usage in tRPC source code
toc: true
---

In this article, we analyze Istanbul usage in tRPC source code. I found this comment — [istanbul ignore if](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/packages/client/src/links/httpBatchLink.ts#L91C12-L91C30). This hints that tRPC uses Istanbul.js, a tool that makes JavaScript test coverage simple.

This one took me a while to figure out that tRPC repository uses [@vitest/coverage-istanbul](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage), I was initially looking to see if there’s any scripts related to test defined in [packages/clients](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/packages/client/src/links/httpBatchLink.ts#L91C12-L91C30) but there were none.

After searching for istanbul across the codebase, that is when I saw Istanbul word in [vitest.config.ts](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/d603d860a3aeb12bbf6e836abd8c5a30c7b5d7a5/vitest.config.ts#L45) test scripts are defined in the [root level’s package.json](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/package.json).

```javascript
"test": "turbo codegen-tests && conc -c \"green,blue\" \"vitest run\" \"pnpm -F tests test-run:tsc\"",
"test-ci": "turbo codegen-tests && conc \"CI=true vitest run - coverage\" \"pnpm -F tests test-run:tsc\"",
"test-watch": "vitest",
```

Below is coverage object picked from vitest.config.ts:

```javascript
coverage: {
 provider: 'istanbul',
 include: ['**/src/**'],
 exclude: [
 '**/www/**',
 '**/examples/**',
 // skip codecov for experimental features
 // FIXME: delete me once they're stable
 '**/next/src/app-dir/**',
 '**/server/src/adapters/next-app-dir/**',
 ],
},
```

Vitest supports another provider as well, it is ‘v8’. By default, provider is set to v8.

Let’s what happens when `test` script is run:

## **test script:**

```javascript
"test": "turbo codegen-tests && conc -c \"green,blue\" \"vitest run\" \"pnpm -F tests test-run:tsc\"",
```

tRPC uses Turbo. Turbo is an incremental bundler and build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust.

## **turbo codegen-tests:**

codegen-tests is a command defined in [turbo.json](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/turbo.json#L19) and when you run this, it executes codegen-tests scripts defined in the packages. This is a monorepo setup.

codegen-scripts in packages:  
\- [client/package.json](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/packages/client/package.json#L27)  
\- [next/package.json](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/packages/next/package.json#L28)  
\- [react-query/package.json](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/packages/react-query/package.json#L19)  
\- [server/package.json](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/packages/server/package.json#L19)

## **conc -c**

conc is a short alias for [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently#usage). Checkout [concurrrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently#usage).

Below is an example usage of concurrently.

```javascript
concurrently "command1 arg" "command2 arg"
(or)
conc "command1 arg" "command2 arg"
```

tRPC uses this below command:

```javascript
conc -c \"green,blue\" \"vitest run\" \"pnpm -F tests test-run:tsc\"
```
