title: useMemo usage in Documenso, an open-source Docusign alternative.
toc: true

In this article, we analyse few arrow functions found in open source projects that are passed in as a parameter to useMemo or useCallback. I found these below list of functions in the wild, there could be more use cases but let’s control our sample size for this analysis.

### useMemo and the arrow function

Let’s first understand what a useMemo is. useMemo is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.

```plaintext
const cachedValue = useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)
```

Read more about [useMemo](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo). React docs provides some great examples such as

* [Skipping expensive recalculations](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#skipping-expensive-recalculations)
    
* [Skipping re-rendering of components](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#skipping-re-rendering-of-components)
    
* [Preventing an Effect from firing too often](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#preventing-an-effect-from-firing-too-often)
    
* [Memoizing a dependency of another Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook)
    
* [Memoizing a function](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-function)
    

#### useMemo in Documenso

[Documenso](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/blob/main/apps/web/src/app/%28dashboard%29/documents/upload-document.tsx#L48) is as an open-source Docusign alternative. I have to admit, Documenso is good!!! I like its user interface and the best part is this is open-source and built using Next.js. You can read their source code to learn best practices such as uploading files, rendering pdf with quality in Next.js and so much more. I have added this repository to my collection to study in depth and hopefully produce some articles like this one in the future.

At [line 48 in upload-document.tsx](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/blob/main/apps/web/src/app/%28dashboard%29/documents/upload-document.tsx#L48), you will find the below code snippet.

```plaintext
const disabledMessage = useMemo(() => {
    if (remaining.documents === 0) {
      return team
        ? msg`Document upload disabled due to unpaid invoices`
        : msg`You have reached your document limit.`;
    }

    if (!session?.user.emailVerified) {
      return msg`Verify your email to upload documents.`;
    }
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [remaining.documents, session?.user.emailVerified, team]);
```

In this case, results are cached based on these below values between re-renders:

* remaining.documents
    
* session?.user.emailVerified
    
* team
    

#### useMemo in Tisqleditor

[tisqleditor](https://github.com/tidbcloud/tisqleditor/tree/main) is a codeMirror6 based SQL code editor which is used in TiDB Cloud Console. I am not sure what a TiDB cloud console is but we are interested in useMemo with arrow function as its parameter.

```plaintext
const activeFile = useMemo(
    () => openedFiles.find((f) => f.id === activeFileId),
    [activeFileId, openedFiles]
)
```

In the above image, you will find that activeFile is assigned the value returned by useMemo call that has two dependencies. activeFileId, openedFiles. This means activeFile results are cached between re-renders.

[React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-function) says that —   
“  
Just as {} creates a different object, function declarations like function() {} and expressions like () =&gt; {} produce a different function on every re-render. By itself, creating a new function is not a problem. This is not something to avoid! However, if the Form component is memoized, presumably you want to skip re-rendering it when no props have changed. A prop that is always different would defeat the point of memoization.  
“

At this point, it is also worth mentioning useCallback.

### useCallback

This below explanation is picked from [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook).

To memoize a function with useMemo, your calculation function would have to return another function:

```plaintext
export default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {
  
  const handleSubmit = useMemo(() => {
       return (orderDetails) => {
         post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
         referrer,
         orderDetails
       });
      };
     }, [productId, referrer]);
   
  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;
}
```

This looks clunky! Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into useCallback instead of useMemo to avoid having to write an extra nested function:

```plaintext
export default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {
 
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
 
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
       referrer,
       orderDetails
     });
    }, [productId, referrer]);
    
    return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;
}
```

The two examples above are completely equivalent. The only benefit to useCallback is that it lets you avoid writing an extra nested function inside. It doesn’t do anything else. [Read more about useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback).

#### useCallback usage in Postiz

[Postiz](https://postiz.com/) is an open-source social media scheduling tool.

At [line 147 in messages.tsx](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app/blob/e3bd1df158d272190ae90aef48cea6ee17142da2/apps/frontend/src/components/messages/messages.tsx#L147), you will find the below code snippet.

```plaintext
const Page: FC<{ page: number; group: string; refChange: any }> = (props) => {
  const { page, group, refChange } = props;
  const fetch = useFetch();
  const { message } = useContext(MarketplaceProvider);
  const visible = usePageVisibility(page);

  const loadMessages = useCallback(async () => {
    return await (await fetch(`/messages/${group}/${page}`)).json();
  }, []);
```

loadMessages contains a cached result except it does not contain any dependencies. Interesting. The component in which this function is defined has the following signature:

```plaintext
const Page: FC<{ page: number; group: string; refChange: any }> = (props) => {
```
